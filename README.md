# block-adblock-webcomponent
Detect if a user is using an Ad Blocker

Based on: https://github.com/sitexw/BlockAdBlock

# Usage

Load the `block-adblock.js` file:
```
<script src="block-adblock.js"></script>
```

Add the Custom Element anywhere on your HTML page:
```
<block-adblock></block-adblock>
```

By default, the element will render a red alert at the top of the web page stating that it's detected an adblocker.
You can of course customize the script in any way you like.
